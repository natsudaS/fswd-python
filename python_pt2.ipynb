    "\n",
    "> Here are the four (most relevant) structuring elements of Python, with some advise when to use which one:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> + Use data structures to store and retrieve data that belong together.\n",
    "> + Use functions to perform a particular task with/without input values, possibly returning some value (or function).\n",
    "> + Use classes to group data and business logic operating on these data together.\n",
    "> + Use modules (i.e., individual `.py` files) to organize code by purpose or category. *(You can have multiple classes in one module, by the way.)*\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Of course, there are more structuring elements, e.g., when it comes to [packaging](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/flow/) your Python code for shipment. These advanced topics are well beyond the scope of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. Creating modules and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A **module** is an object that Python automatically creates out of any `.py` file. The module is named like the file - e.g., `app` if the file is called `📄app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **package** (also called [regular packages](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages)) is an object that Python automatically creates out of any folder containing an `📄__init__.py` file. `📄__init__.py` could be the only `.py` file in that folder, but it makes more sense to place multiple modules into such a folder. The package is named like the folder, e.g., `myapp` if the folder is called `📁myapp/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Often, Python programmers call `.py` files *\"modules\"* and folders containing an `📄__init__.py` file *\"packages\"*. But they actually mean the objects that Python creates, not the files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustration, consider this example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "┬ repository/\n",
    "├── tools.py             <-- module\n",
    "├── worker.py            <-- module\n",
    "└─┬ myapp/               <-- folder that Python shall interpret as package\n",
    "  ├── __init__.py        <-- this file makes Python treat the folder as package\n",
    "  ├── __main__.py        <-- use this file to offer a command-line interface\n",
    "  ├── app.py\n",
    "  ├── schema.sql         <-- non-.py files can be placed here as well\n",
    "  └─┬ tests/             <-- package within a package\n",
    "    ├── __init__.py\n",
    "    └── …\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `tools` is a Python module created from `📄tools.py`.\n",
    "+ `myapp` is a Python package created from `📁myapp/`, since it contains an `📄__init__.py`.\n",
    "  + Notice how a package folder is allowed to contain also non-`.py` files.\n",
    "+ The package `tests` is nested within `myapp`.\n",
    "+ Notice the special [`📄__main__.py` file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#main-py-in-python-packages) - which we won't discuss further.\n",
    "  + I've included it here since (at some point or another) you will likely encounter error messages that reference `📄__main__.py` or `__main__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The use of `📄__init__.py` is not the only way to define a package. There are also [namespace packages](https://docs.python.org/3.11/reference/import.html#namespace-packages) - im most cases, you won't need this alternative, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This occasion is as good as any to remind you of the [Python styleguide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), commonly just called **PEP 8**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> On [module and package naming](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names), PEP 8 tells us to use short all-lowercase names, and to avoid underscores (`_`) particularly in package names.  \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Tools like [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) (which can be integrated with your favorite code editor, e.g., [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter)) help you to enforce the numerous advises of PEP 8, but of course you can follow PEP 8 also manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. Understanding imports\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section about decorators, we have already used the **import** mechanism of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import wraps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By importing, we make code of one module available to another module, just as it were written plainly in the importing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's assume the module `tools` includes a function named `items_with_char()`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file 'tools.py' = module 'tools'\n",
    "\n",
    "def items_with_char(items: list, char: str) -> list:\n",
    "    return [item for item in items if item.count(char)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use use this function in another module, we import it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file 'worker.py'\n",
    "\n",
    "from tools import items_with_char\n",
    "\n",
    "items = ['apple', 'orange', 'plum']\n",
    "print(items_with_char(items, 'a'))  # ['apple', 'orange']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That import statement is equivalent to writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file 'worker.py'\n",
    "\n",
    "def items_with_char(items: list, char: str) -> list:\n",
    "    return [item for item in items if item.count(char)]\n",
    "\n",
    "items = ['apple', 'orange', 'plum']\n",
    "print(items_with_char(items, 'a'))  # ['apple', 'orange']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Order matters: this would raise an error, since the function is called before it has been defined:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> # file 'worker.py'\n",
    "> \n",
    "> items = ['apple', 'orange', 'plum']\n",
    "> print(items_with_char(items, 'a'))  # program exits with a 'NameError' message\n",
    "> \n",
    "> from tools import items_with_char\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we used a statement that imports individually named objects, i.e., variables, functions, classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module import individual_object\n",
    "\n",
    "# access imported object like so:\n",
    "#     individual_object\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a complete module (i.e. copy its complete code), you may write this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module import *\n",
    "\n",
    "# access imported objects like so:\n",
    "#     individual_object\n",
    "#     crucial_function()\n",
    "#     ...\n",
    "# imported module and importing module share the same namespace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Beware this somewhat quirky behavior: the `import *` statement [does not import](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#more-on-modules) objects whose names start with an `_` (underscore).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, such a wholesale import is not recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ All that module's objects become part of the importing module's [namespace](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-namespace). Let's assume that both the imported and the importing module defined a function `crucial_function()`: this screams trouble!\n",
    "+ Importing a complete module is akin to executing its code. This doesn't matter if the module consists only of function definitions. But what if it were to execute (potentially damaging) business logic that you are not aware of?\n",
    "+ By importing a complete module, you import also that module's import statements. This makes bug-fixing potentially harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is a better idea to explicitly import only those elements which you are going to use later on:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module import func, var\n",
    "\n",
    "result = func(2*var)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you want to import a lot of functionality from an external module (or package for that matter). To avoid spelling out the import of every single object (`from module import obj1, obj2, ..., objN`) and circumvent some of the issues of `from module import *`, you can write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module\n",
    "\n",
    "# access any object like so:\n",
    "#     module.individual_object\n",
    "#     module.crucial_function()\n",
    "#     module. ...\n",
    "# imported module gets its own namespace 'module'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...or this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module as m\n",
    "\n",
    "# access any object like so:\n",
    "#     m.individual_object\n",
    "#     m.crucial_function()\n",
    "#     m. ...\n",
    "# imported module gets its own namespace 'm'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This import statement does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ First, it creates a new namespace, nicely separating `crucial_function()` from `module.crucial_function()`.\n",
    "+ Second, this import statement does not actually copy the code, but rather creates a reference to it. Most of the times this doesn't make a difference, but [in some cases](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19185936) it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, don't do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module1 import *\n",
    "from module2 import *\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...but rather do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module1 import obj1, obj2\n",
    "import module2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Importing from a package follows the same logic as importing from a module. The [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) offers some good explanation.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It is worth mentioning that upon importing a package, the code of that package's `__init__` module will be executed.

    "+ [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/): This is a great resource if you want to improve your coding skills by solving some programming problems. Upon [registering](https://dmoj.ca/accounts/register/) you are asked to set your default programming language (naturally, you want to select `Python 3`). Here is a small selection of problems I recommend:\n",
    "  + [dmopc15c7p2](https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc15c7p2)\n",
    "  + [ccc19j1](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc19j1)\n",
    "  + [ccc18j1](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc18j1)\n",
    "  + [coci16c1p1](https://dmoj.ca/problem/coci16c1p1)\n",
    "  + [ecoo17r1p1](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ecoo17r1p1)\n",
    "  + [ecoo19r2p1](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ecoo19r2p1)\n",
    "  + [cco99p2](https://dmoj.ca/problem/cco99p2)\n",
    "+ [Python reference documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): Here, you will find authoritative documentation on the Python language and its standard library. As an added benefit, the documentation collects also how-tos, FAQs and setup instructions. If you are looking for design explanations, head over to the [PEP](https://peps.python.org/) repository.\n",

    "> As a general remark, it is useful to keep in mind the [four types of documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/) when searching for particular information about any piece of software. The four types are:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> + Tutorial: a beginner-friendly lesson that guides the reader from start to end. Tutorials are useful when you want to learn a new skill (as opposed to learning something to solve a concrete problem).\n",
    "> + How-to guide: an instruction of how to solve a particular problem. A how-to guide is typically more focused than a tutorial, and it often assumes some familiarity with the topic.\n",
    "> + Reference: a (technical) description of the software. Reference documentation is code-centric and typically mirrors the code structure - it aims to systematically cover all parts of the software. While you will find information how to operate a granular part of the software (e.g., how to call a particular function), it will not tell you how the individual parts work together.\n",
    "> + Explanation: some reasoning about (a particular part of) the software. An explanation often clarifies why the software was designed in a particular way, or discusses central concepts that guided the software implementation.\n",
